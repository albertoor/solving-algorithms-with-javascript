/*
    Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out 
    which one of the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number 
    usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs 
    a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and 
    return a position of this number.

    ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes 
    of the elements start from 1 (not 0)

    Examples

    iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

    iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd

*/

const iqTest = (numbers) => {
  const numbersArr = numbers.split(" ");
  const oddsArr = numbersArr.filter((number) => number % 2 == 1);
  const evensArr = numbersArr.filter((number) => number % 2 == 0);

  let result;
  if (evensArr.length == 1) {
    result = evensArr[0];
  } else {
    result = oddsArr[0];
  }

  const position = numbersArr.indexOf(result) + 1;
  return position;
};

console.log(iqTest("2 4 7 8 10")); // => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

console.log(iqTest("1 2 1 1")); // => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
