/*
    An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly STEPS steps, 
    for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, U , or a downhill, D step. Hikes always start and end at sea 
    level, and each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:

        * A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level 
        and ending with a step down to sea level.
        * A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level 
        and ending with a step up to sea level.

    Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.

    EXAMPLE
    steps = 8 path = [DDUUUUDD]

    The hiker first enters a valley 2 units deep. Then they climb out and up onto a mountain 2 units high. Finally, 
    the hiker returns to sea level and ends the hike.

    Function Description

        Complete the countingValleys function in the editor below.
        countingValleys has the following parameter(s):

        * int steps: the number of steps on the hike
        * string path: a string describing the path
    
    Returns
        * int: the number of valleys traversed
    
    Input Format
        The first line contains an integer steps, the number of steps in the hike.
        The second line contains a single string path, of steps characters that describe the path.

    Constraints
        * 2 <= steps <= 10^6
        * path[i] Ïµ {UD}
 */

const countingValleys = (steps, path) => {
  let numberOfValleysTraversed = 0;
  let level = 0;

  for (let index = 0; index < steps; index++) {
    const element = path[index];
    if (element === "U") level += 1;
    if (element === "D") level -= 1;

    if (level === 0 && element === "U") numberOfValleysTraversed += 1;
  }
  return numberOfValleysTraversed;
};

console.log(countingValleys(8, "UDDDUDUU"));
console.log(countingValleys(12, "DDUUDDUDUUUD"));
